<h2>Singletons</h2>
<p>A singleton is a design pattern that allows a class to be accessible from anywhere. A singleton
creates a single instance of a class, allowing its information to be accessible as long as the program
is running.
This is especially
important when designing class structure in games. Some objects, such as 
<pre>
<code>
// singleton
static GameController* ptrInstance;

// Access reference (all public methods will be static)
static GameController& Instance() 
{
	if (!ptrInstance) 
	{
		ptrInstance = new GameController;
	}
	return *ptrInstance;
};
</code>
</pre>
