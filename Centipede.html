<h1>Centipede</h1>

<p>The first project I'll be sharing is a recreation of an old arcade game, <i>Centipede</i>. Over the 
course of 10 weeks, I was tasked with recreating the game as closely as possible while learning about
a plethora of coding design patterns to ease the process and build the game on a structurally sound
infrastrucutre. Below are a couple of patterns I utilized.</p>

<h2>Singletons</h2>
<p>A singleton is a design pattern that allows a class to be accessible from anywhere. This pattern
creates a single instance of a class, allowing its information to be accessible as long as the program
is running. This functionality can be very useful when designing class structure in games. 
Some objects, such as the enemies and mushrooms, hold different data on position, health, etc. But managerial
classes such as an enemy manager or game manager are perfect with a singleton structure.</p>
<pre>
<code>
// singleton
static GameController* ptrInstance;

// Access reference (all public methods will be static)
static GameController& Instance() 
{
	if (!ptrInstance) 
	{
		ptrInstance = new GameController;
	}
	return *ptrInstance;
};
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Finite State Machines</h2>
<p>A finite state machine is incredibly useful for managing different actions for a game object to perform.
They reduce the complexity of coding by defining an object's actions into distinct states, clearly defining
what actions will be performed, and under what conditions the object will switch to a different state. 
Below is an FSM for the centipede object, with 10 states: four for moving across the screen, four for 
turning, and two for turning while poisoned.

<pre>
<code>
class MoveFSM {
public:
	static const MoveRightAndDownwards StateMoveRightAndDownwards;
	static const MoveLeftAndDownwards StateMoveLeftAndDownwards;
	static const MoveRightAndUpwards StateMoveRightAndUpwards;
	static const MoveLeftAndUpwards StateMoveLeftAndUpwards;
	static const TurnDownSwitchToLeft StateTurnDownSwitchToLeft;
	static const TurnDownSwitchToRight StateTurnDownSwitchToRight;
	static const TurnUpSwitchToLeft StateTurnUpSwitchToLeft;
	static const TurnUpSwitchToRight StateTurnUpSwitchToRight;
	static const PoisonedTurnDownSwitchToLeft StatePoisonedTurnDownSwitchToLeft;
	static const PoisonedTurnDownSwitchToRight StatePoisonedTurnDownSwitchToRight;
};
</code>
</pre>

<p>Looking at one of the turn states, the centipede's action during this state is to complete a frame of
animation by turning down and to the right. Every frame, we check to see if this movement is complete. If it is,
we call the GetNextState function to determine the centipede's next state. After a centipede completes a turn,
there are four different states it could go into. The state machine clearly breaks down the conditions
required for each state to begin.

<pre>
<code>
void TurnDownSwitchToRight::Update(CentipedeHead * chead) const 
{
	chead->TurnDownSwitchToRight();	// complete a part of the turn
}

bool TurnDownSwitchToRight::MovementIsComplete(CentipedeHead * chead) const 
{
	return chead->TurnisComplete();
}

// called when the turn is complete, determine next state
const MoveState * TurnDownSwitchToRight::GetNextState(CentipedeHead * chead) const 
{
	chead->FinishTurn();
	
	// if the centipede is touching a poisoned mushroom, turn downwards
	if (chead->IsTouchingPoisonedMushroomOnRight()) return &MoveFSM::StatePoisonedTurnDownSwitchToLeft;

	// if the centipede will collide with an object, turn away from it
	if (chead->WillCollideOnRight()) 
	{
		// turn up if the centipede is at the bottom of the screen
		if (chead->WillPassBelowPlayableArea()) return &MoveFSM::StateTurnUpSwitchToLeft;
		// otherwise, turn down
		else return &MoveFSM::StateTurnDownSwitchToLeft;
	}
	
	// otherwise, move forward
	else 
	{
		chead->PrepareForForwardMovement();
		return &MoveFSM::StateMoveRightAndDownwards;
	}
}
</code>
