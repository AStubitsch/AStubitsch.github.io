    <h1>Game Engine</h1>

    <img src="../images/game engine scene.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>
        For almost six months, I was tasked with creating a functioning 3D game engine. Creating this game engine
        was an incredibly difficult dask, but was a very fulfilling experience. It gave me very low-level
        access to systems code, providing much more direct control over how a game runs behind the scenes, aspects
        that most people don't even think about. Over six months, I had to implement complicated systems such as
        alarm registration for timed events, keyboard input registration, and even tasks as simple as rendering
        game objects on-screen took time to perform accurately.
    </p>

    <p>Below are a couple snippets of some of the work I did in putting my engine together.</p>

    <h2>Collision Detection</h2>

    <p>
        Out of all the systems for my engine, designing collision was probably the most work, taking several
        weeks to fully develop. Collision is a crucial part of developing games, as many events take place
        as a result of it. When a bullet hits another player, for instance, it is collision detection that registers
        the hit, and as a result, performs an action on what to do next in-game.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following code demonstrates one of the many collision methods utilized; in this case, collision
        between two objects using sphere colliders. To measure the calculation correctly, you measure the distance
        between the two spheres' centers, and compare it to the sum of their radii. If their distance is less, they are
        colliding.
    </p>

<pre>
<code>
bool MathToolsâ€‹::Intersect(const CollisionVolumeBSphere & A, const CollisionVolumeBSphere & B) 
{
	// if the distance between the two spheres' centers is less than the sum of ther radii, they intersect
	return (
		sqrt(pow(B.GetCenter().X() - A.GetCenter().X(), 2) + 
		pow(B.GetCenter().Y() - A.GetCenter().Y(), 2) + 
		pow(B.GetCenter().Z() - A.GetCenter().Z(), 2)) 
		< A.GetRadius() + B.GetRadius()
	);
}
</code>

    <h2>Keyboard Input</h2>

    <p></p>

<pre>
    <code>
void SingleKeyEventManager::ProcessKeyEvent() {
    // key press events
    if (Keyboard::GetKeyState(key)) 
    {
        // execute if key was not down on the last frame
        if (keyDown == false) 
        {
            keyDown = true;
            for (auto const& x : keyMap[Inputable::EVENT_TYPE::KEY_PRESS]) 
            {
                InputableAttorney::GameLoop::KeyPressed(x, key);
            }
        }
    }

    // key release events
    else 
    {
        // execute if key was down on the last frame
        if (keyDown == true) 
        {
            keyDown = false;
            for (auto const& x : keyMap[Inputable::EVENT_TYPE::KEY_RELEASE]) 
            {
                InputableAttorney::GameLoop::KeyReleased(x, key);
            }
        }
    }
}
    </code>
